I am an MS by Research student at [Signal Processing and Communication Research Centre (SPCRC)](https://spcrc.iiit.ac.in/), IIIT Hyderabad. I am working under the guidance of [Dr. Prasad Krishnan](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~prasad.krishnan/). My research interests include Error Correcting Codes, and Information Theory. 

> I am currently looking for PhD and research opportunities in the field of Error Correcting Codes, Information Theory, and Machine Learning. If you have any opportunities, please feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-siddheshwar/).

I had the privilege of working with [Dr. Prasad Krishnan](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~prasad.krishnan/) and [Dr. Lakshmi Prasad Natarajan](https://people.iith.ac.in/lakshminatarajan/) on Recursive Subproduct Codes. Our work, "[Recursive Subproduct Codes with Reed-Muller-like Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15678)", was presented at ISIT 2024.

## Slightly more about me

During my undergraduate study, I got interested in animating mathematics and visualizing Signal Processing and Communication concepts through [MANIM](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) (Math ANIMation engine) of [3Blue1Brown (Grant Sanderson)](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown). During Google Summer of Code '21 at the [Processing Foundation](https://github.com/processing), I worked on a math animation library called [p5.teach.js](https://github.com/two-ticks/p5.teach.js). It helps teachers and professors build animations without dealing with bulky setups and allows them to make animations from the web-editor without the need to install any extra software and with minimal coding.

In July 2022, I started my MS in ECE by Research at IIIT-Hyderabad. During the Monsoon'22 semester, I took courses in Modern Coding Theory with [Dr. Prasad Krishnan](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~prasad.krishnan/) and Information Theory with [Dr. Lalitha Vadlamani](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~lalitha.v/) and [Dr. Arti Yardi](https://sites.google.com/view/artiyardi/home). These courses not only helped me build a strong foundation in Information Theory but also piqued my interest in exploring Error Correcting Codes further.

Later on, I enrolled in courses such as Information Theoretic Methods in Computer Science and Information Theoretic Methods in Privacy, both of which were taught by Dr. Prasad Krishnan and [Dr. Gowtham R. Kurri](https://sites.google.com/view/gowtham-r-kurri/home). These introduced me concepts like Shearer's lemma, Bregman's theorem, Loomis-Whitney inequality, Pinsker's Inequality, Maximal Leakage and much more. These courses introduced me to research topics like Private Information Retrieval (PIR) and Index Codes. 

In addition to these, I also studied Statistical Methods in AI, Wireless Communication, Signal Detection and Estimation Theory, and Mathematical Foundations of Signal Processing, which exposed me to research topics related to Signal Processing and Machine Learning, such as Automatic Speech Detection and Recognition and Forward gradient learning.
